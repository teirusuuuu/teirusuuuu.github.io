        <h1>Reaching The Door</h1>
        <p>As you reach closer to the door, you hear some of the same ambience from before, but now more muffled, as if it's coming from behind the door. A very vibrant blue lighting can be seen from underneath, and above the door. You also feel a cool, calm breeze eminating from whatever is behind the door. You're now interested and considering opening the door, or leaving it be and turning back..</p>
